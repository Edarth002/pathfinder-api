# 🧭 Intelligent Campus Navigation System

This is a full-stack application for pedestrian navigation on university campuses, tailored for the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). It combines an intelligent pathfinding algorithm with geospatial data and user preferences to guide students, staff, and visitors efficiently.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/campus-pathfinder.git
cd pathfinder-api
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd pathfinder-api
npm install
```

**.env example:**

```env

npm run dev
```

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🗺️ How the Pathfinding Works

1. All campus locations are stored as **nodes**.
2. Paths (edges) connect them, with weights for distance, accessibility, and other metrics.
3. A\* or Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied based on weights and preferences.
4. The algorithm returns the **most optimized route**, which is rendered on a map.

Example preference impact:

* "Avoid stairs": increases weights of stair-connected paths
* "Prefer shaded": reduces weights of tree-lined paths

## 🧪 Sample Data Schema

### `locations` Table

| id | name             | type     | lat    | lng    |
| -- | ---------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1  | Faculty of Engr. | building | 6.8521 | 7.4033 |

### `paths` Table

| id | from\_node | to\_node | distance | has\_stairs | is\_shaded |
| -- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
